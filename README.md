<p>Mancala is one of the oldest board games known to society, with traces back to ancient Egypt. In this project, I made it using a modern-day computer!</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>The goal of Mancala is to have more marbles in your store (the two big pits to the left and right) than the other player by the time one player has no more marbles to play on their side of the board. Player 1's store is on the right, Player 2's store is on the left. In this iteration of the game, the numbers represent the number of marbles in a pit. Clicking on a pit will start your turn. You will move marbles as many pits counter-clockwise as there are marbles in the starting pit. The two players can only put marbles in their respective stores. Special rules are described further in the how-to play button.</p>
